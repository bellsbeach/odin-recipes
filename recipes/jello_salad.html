    <h1>Jello Salad</h1>
    <img src="../recipe_images/jello_salad.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TThis truly is a unique taste combination; I think 
        it caused my brother Eddie a lifetime aversion to 
        horseradish. I on the other hand loved it. When grandma 
        passed away a few years ago we inherited her recipe 
        collection, including this one. I just found it this 
        weekend and had to make it. I didn't do a good job mixing 
        the cucumbers and pineapple in, so the salad is not as 
        evenly dispersed in the jello as I remember it. But it was 
        still delicious.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) package Jell-O lime gelatin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups hot water</li>
        <li>2 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cucumbers, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons horseradish (or more if you want it spicier)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon grated onion</li>
        <li>3/4 cup jelly, your fav flavor</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups diced or crushed drained canned pineapple 
            (you cannot use fresh pineapple with gelatins. The 
            bromelain enzyme in fresh pineapple will keep the 
            gelatin from bonding.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, dissolve lime jello and salt in 2 cups of 
            hot water (don't use boiling water, just regular hot water).</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups cold water. Chill until slightly thickened 
            - the consistency of egg whites, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add jelly to small bowl, and mix with a spoon or 
            fork slightly to make it easier to spread</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl mix cucumber, horseradish, grated onion, and vinegar.</li>
        <li>Fold pineapple and cucumber mixture into jello. Pour into a jello mold 
            and chill for several hours (about 6) until gelatin sets.</li>
        <li>To remove jello from its mold, fill up a basin half-way with hot water. 
            Lower the jello mold into the hot water, metal side down, until the water 
            comes up almost to the edge of the mold. Keep it there 5 seconds and 
            remove. Place a plate on top of the jello mold and turn upside down. The 
            jello salad should just slide out.</li>
        
    </ol>
