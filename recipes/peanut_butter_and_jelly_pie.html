    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe from Seattle's <em>High 5 Pie</em>, a pie shop that used
        to be in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. I remember going there 
        after soccer practice with my mom and best friend. YUM!
    </p>
    <p>The peanut butter layer has a rich, but not too sweet mixture 
        of peanut butter, cream cheese, sugar, milk, honey and a pinch 
        of salt. Then for the jelly layer, I simply used store bought 
        strawberry jelly, but I think homemade jam or jelly would be amazing. 
        And then it's topped with fresh whipping cream and a handful of 
        chopped peanuts.</p>
