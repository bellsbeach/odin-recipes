    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Autumn is time for apple focused recipes. And gooey, golden brown, 
        bubbly apple crisp is a delectable dessert that combines all the 
        fabulous flavors of fall. With plenty of tender, juicy apples 
        nestled under a layer of sweet, crunchy oat topping, it’s easy to 
        see why apple crisp is a guaranteed crowd pleaser. From potlucks 
        to family dinners, holiday meals to chilly autumn afternoons at home, 
        apple crisp makes any occasion more delicious.

    <p>TInspired by Betty’s classic Dutch apple pie, this easy apple crisp 
        recipe is oh so simple (and fun) to assemble—and it fills the entire 
        house with the incredible aroma of apples and cinnamon as it bakes to 
        perfection. Good thing it’s served warm because you won’t want to wait 
        to have a taste! But before you dig in, remember that a scoop of vanilla 
        ice cream or dollop of homemade whipped cream takes this already amazing 
        dish to the next level.</p>
